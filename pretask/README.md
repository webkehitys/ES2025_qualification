# Static Website Design

In this project, you are expected to develop a static website for a client using only HTML and CSS. The website must consist of four distinct pages, which will be detailed in the following sections.

The client has provided media files, including some media, icons, and text. You are free to use these or create your own custom assets.

As the website will be publicly accessible, it is crucial that it adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG) and implements SEO best practices.

The website must be responsive and support at least the following viewports:

- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

No server-side or client-side frameworks are allowed. CSS preprocessors may be used.
All HTML and CSS code, including any generated code, must pass W3C validations.

## Competitor Information

The module will be assessed using Google Chrome and Firefox. Accessibility will be tested with axe DevTools and Accessibility Inspector. Overall performance, best practices, and SEO will be evaluated using Lighthouse.

## Task Submission Guidelines

The project must be submitted by the deadline of **18.08.2024, midnight** **info@webkehitys.fi**

Your submission should include a complete GitHub repository containing all the required components as outlined in the project brief. The repository must include the full website, ensuring it is responsive, adheres to accessibility standards, and passes W3C validations.

## Website Requirements

The goal of the website is to promote a suite of AI-driven APIs. Potential customers should be able to learn about the capabilities of these APIs, explore pricing options, and get to know the team behind the product.

You are encouraged to add more information and elements to all pages as you see fit. It is also permissible to include links pointing to pages that do not yet exist (e.g., a login page).

For each page, example text and additional materials are provided in the media files. However, you are not required to use all the provided media content.

The following pages must be implemented:

### Home Page
- Create a short, engaging introduction to the product.
- Display key product information clearly.
- Use visually appealing media to capture attention.
- Include links to the product and pricing pages for more details.

### Product Page

- List all available AI APIs in the suite.
- Highlight the features of each API.
- Make it easy for visitors to understand what each API does.

### Pricing Page

- Clearly explain the pricing structure for each API.
- Make it easy for visitors to compare prices and understand the value.
- Ensure transparency in the pricing details.

### Team Page

- Introduce the current team members with brief profiles.
- Highlight the core values of the company.
- Mention that the company is looking to grow its team.

### Global Elements

The following elements must be present on all pages:

- **Header**: Must include at least the product name in text form or a logo.
- **Navigation**: Should contain easily accessible links to all pages. The navigation should indicate the currently active page for better user orientation.
- **Footer**: Must include at least a copyright notice, contact information, and social media links.
  
These elements can be enhanced with additional information where appropriate.
